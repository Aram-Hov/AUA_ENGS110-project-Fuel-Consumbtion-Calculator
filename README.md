This is my AUA ENGS110 2020 individual project
                                                   
                                                   Objective


The objective of this algorithm is calculating the fuel consumption of a given vehicle, taking in account such factors as range, speed, and volume of an engine. This algorithm is very useful, esspecially in an era where car manufacturing is as high as never before. Nowadays any vehicle using internal combustion engine needs an algorithm that will calculate the comsumption and offer some changes, in order to decrease the expences and encourage to use the fuel effectively, in order to avoid unneccessary environmental impacts.

                                                   Features     
the main feature is obviously calculating the consumption of fuel. In addition, the algorithm may recomend some changes in driving style to make the consumption more effective, which means the user will use less ammount of fuel for a greater range.
Also, the algorithm may calculate the expences caused by burnt fuel, which will be more useful in hybrid vehicles. After calculating the ammount of money needed to refuel the car, the algorithm will recomend to switch from burning fuel, to using electrical resources.
                                             The target audience
The target audience for this algorithm are car manufacturing companies, as-well-as car users themselves.
                                            
                          The problems that should be solved during development of project.
This algorithm should be rather complicated as it should take into account diverse driving styles, speed, and engine volume. The algorithm should also be ready to execute with different fuel types (oil, diesel, etc.)
