# AUA_ENGS110 project-Vehicle Fuel Consumbtion Calculator
This is my AUA ENGS110 2020 individual project
                                                   
                                                   Objective


The objective of this algorithm is calculating the fuel consumption of a given vehicle, taking in account such factors as range, speed, and volume of an engine. This algorithm is very useful, esspecially in an era where car manufacturing is as high as never before. Nowadays any vehicle using internal combustion engine needs an algorithm that will calculate the comsumption and motivate users to change driving style for economy and ecological reasons
                                                   Features     
the main feature is obviously calculating the consumption of fuel. In addition, the algorithm may have a database of speciic vehicles with their average consumption, and there are 3 main ways of accessing th data, firstly printing all available vehicles, secondly seeking for vehicles in specific range of consumption, and at last looking for a vehicle via printing its brand and model.
                                             The target audience
The target audience for this algorithm are car manufacturing companies, as-well-as car users themselves.
                                            
                          The problems that should be solved during development of project.
This algorithm should be rather complicated as it should take into account diverse driving styles, speed, and engine volume. 



                                            main features

As mentioned above, the main stories are - simulating the algorithm usage in a vehicle, printing out all the vehicles available in the database, looking for vehicles in specific range of consumption, and printing out the brand and the model of the vehicle.
